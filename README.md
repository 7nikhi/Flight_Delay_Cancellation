# Flight Delay and Cancellation

### Report Link : https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/reports/6009cbf9-c0fc-4eeb-83f0-29280ef3473b/c4a1fe2eecf613e770a5?experience=power-bi

## Problem Statement

This report helps users understand flight delays and cancellations better. It allows the users to select the best airline and airport from the report with fewer delays & cancellations. It also lets them know the average delay & departure time, with the insights gained from this report, users can choose airlines and airports that minimize departure and arrival delays by addressing the underlying factors causing these issues.

Since, the percentage of arrival delay (almost 36.5 %) of total flights & percentage of departure delay (around 37 %), thus in all they must work on improving their services. 

Also since the average arrival delay is approximately 5 minutes & departure is approximately 10 minutes, thus they must try to reduce it.


### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Load data into Power BI Desktop, dataset is a csv file.
- Step 2 : Open power query editor & in view tab under Data preview section, check "column distribution", "column quality" & "column profile" options.
- Step 3 : Also since by default, profile will be opened only for 1000 rows so you need to select "column profiling based on entire dataset".
- Step 4 : During the ETL process for Flights, Airlines, and Airports data, we identified issues such as incomplete records, null values, and irrelevant information. To ensure the data is ready for analysis and reporting, we performed transformations using Power Query Editor. This optimization ensures that our data is clean, complete, and structured for effective analysis and reporting purposes.
- Step 5 : In the model view of Power BI, we have established both active and inactive relationships between the Flights table and the Airline/Airport tables. This setup enables us to utilize measures with these inactive relationships as well. This approach provides flexibility in data analysis, allowing us to apply different perspectives and filters to our calculations as needed, thereby optimizing our ability to derive insights
- Step 6 : To calculate metrics such as average arrival delay time, average departure delay time, total flights, number of arrival delays, number of departure delays, percentage of arrival delays, percentage of departure delays, and cancellation rate, we excluded null values from the "Arrival Delay" column, "Departure Delay" column as these represent less than 1% of the total data. This ensures our analysis is based on complete and reliable information for accurate insights.
- Step 7 : In the report view, under the view tab, theme was selected.
- Step 8 : The new visualizations added using the three ellipses in the report view provide users with enhanced insights into various metrics related to airlines and airports. These visuals are designed to facilitate a deeper understanding of the data, enabling users to analyze key performance indicators such as arrival and departure delays, cancellation rates, total flights, and percentages of delays. By leveraging these visuals, users can make informed decisions based on comprehensive and visually represented data, leading to more effective strategies and actions.
- Step 9 : Visual filters (Slicers) were added for four fields named "Country", "State", "City", "Airline" & "Airport".
- Step 10 : Six card visuals have been added to the canvas, each highlighting crucial metrics for airlines and airports:

           Total Flights: Shows the total number of flights recorded.
           
           Average Departure Delay (Minutes): Displays the average delay in minutes for departures.
           
           Average Arrival Delay (Minutes): Indicates the average delay in minutes for arrivals.
           
           Percentage of Arrival Delay: Represents the percentage of flights that experience arrival delays.
           
           Percentage of Departure Delay: Shows the percentage of flights that experience departure delays.
           
           Cancellation Rate: Displays the rate of flight cancellations as a percentage of total flights scheduled.

           These card visuals provide a quick snapshot of key performance indicators, allowing users to swiftly assess performance, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions to improve operational efficiency and passenger satisfaction.
           
- Step 10 : A bar chart was also added to the report design area representing the number of satisfied & neutral/unsatisfied customers. While creating this visual, field named "Gender" was also added to the Legends bucket, thus number of customers are also seggregated according the gender. 
- Step 11 : Ratings Visual was used to represent different ratings mentioned below,

  (a) Baggage Handling

  (b) Check-in Services
  
  (c) Cleanliness
  
  (d) Ease of online booking
  
  (e) Food & Drink
  
  (f) In-flight Entertainment

  (g) In-flight Service
  
  (h) In-flight wifi service
  
  (i) Leg Room service
  
  (j) On-board service
  
  (k) Online boarding
  
  (l) Seat comfort
  
  (m) Departure & arrival time convenience
  
In our dataset, Some parameters were assigned value 0, representing those parameters are not applicable for some customers.

All these values have been ignored while calculating average rating for each of the parameters mentioned above.

- Step 12 : In the report view, under the insert tab, two text boxes were added to the canvas, in one of them name of the airlines was mentioned & in the other one company's tagline was written.
- Step 13 : In the report view, under the insert tab, using shapes option from elements group a rectangle was inserted & similarly using image option company's logo was added to the report design area. 
- Step 14 : Calculated column was created in which, customers were grouped into various age groups.

for creating new column following DAX expression was written;
       
        Age Group = 
        
        if(airline_passenger_satisfaction[Age]<=25, "0-25 (25 included)",
        
        if(airline_passenger_satisfaction[Age]<=50, "25-50 (50 included)",
        
        if(airline_passenger_satisfaction[Age]<=75, "50-75 (75 included)",
        
        "75-100 (100 included)")))

- Step 15 : New measure was created to find total count of customers.

Following DAX expression was written for the same,
        
        Count of Customers = COUNT(airline_passenger_satisfaction[ID])
        
A card visual was used to represent count of customers.

 - Step 16 : New measure was created to find  % of customers,
 
 Following DAX expression was written to find % of customers,
 
         % Customers = (DIVIDE(airline_passenger_satisfaction[Count of Customers], 129880)*100)
 
 A card visual was used to represent this perecntage.

 - Step 17 : New measure was created to calculate total distance travelled by flights & a card visual was used to represent total distance.
 
 Following DAX expression was written to find total distance,
 
         Total Distance Travelled = SUM(airline_passenger_satisfaction[Flight Distance])
    
 A card visual was used to represent this total distance.
